            <td>1. The first mechanical computer, called Mark 1, was completed in 1944. It used the base-2 binary system, was programmable, and made of vacuum tubes, relays, magnets, and gears. Mark 1 had a memory for 72 numbers and could perform 23-digit multiplication in 4 seconds</td>
            <td>2. The first programmable computers were large, complex, and used vacuum tubes. They used punched film or magnetic drums to store programs and data, and were programmed using machine language. </td>
            <td>3. The ENIAC was composed of 40 panels and contained 17,468 vacuum tubes, 7,200 crystal diodes, 1,500 relays, 70,000 resistors, 10,000 capacitors and around 5 million hand-soldered joints. It weighed more than 27 tons, took up 1800 square feet, and consumed 150 kW of power. It operated until 1957.</td>
            <td>4. The main characteristics of first generation of computers (1940s-1950s) Power – consume a lot of electricity and generate a lot of heat. Speed and size – very slow and very large in size (often taking up entire room). Input/output devices – punched cards and paper tape.</td>
            <td>5. A compatible computer is one that can run software and hardware from different sources without issue. Compatibility is important because it allows users to use a variety of software and hardware without conflict. </td>
